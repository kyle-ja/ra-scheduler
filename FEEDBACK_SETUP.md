# Feedback Feature Setup

The feedback feature has been successfully implemented in your RA Scheduler App. Here's what's been added:

## Features Added

1. **Feedback Button** - Located in the navigation bar next to the "Log Out" button
2. **Modal Form** with the following fields:
   - Name (optional)
   - Category dropdown (Bug, Feature Request, General Feedback)
   - Feedback/Suggestion (required)
   - Email (optional, for follow-up)
3. **Email Integration** - Sends feedback directly to kyleanthony.kja@gmail.com

## Email Configuration Setup

To enable the email functionality, you need to configure your email credentials:

### For Gmail (Recommended):

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate an App-Specific Password**:
   - Go to your Google Account settings
   - Navigate to Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords
   - Generate a new app password for "Mail"
3. **Update .env.local** with your credentials:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

### Alternative Email Services:

If you prefer to use a different email service (like Outlook, Yahoo, etc.), update the transporter configuration in `pages/api/feedback.ts`:

```javascript
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
  host: 'your-smtp-host.com',
  port: 587,
  secure: false,
  auth: {
    user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
    pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
  },
});
```

## Files Modified/Added

- `components/FeedbackModal.tsx` (new) - The feedback modal component
- `pages/api/feedback.ts` (new) - API endpoint for handling feedback submissions
- `components/Navbar.tsx` (modified) - Added feedback button and modal integration
- `.env.local` (modified) - Added email configuration variables
- `package.json` (modified) - Added nodemailer dependencies

## Testing

1. Start your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to any page with the navbar
3. Click the "Feedback" button (golden colored, next to Log Out)
4. Fill out the form and submit
5. Check your email at kyleanthony.kja@gmail.com for the feedback

## Troubleshooting

- **Emails not sending**: Check your email credentials in `.env.local`
- **Modal not opening**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **Styling issues**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

## Security Notes

- Never commit your actual email credentials to version control
- The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore`
- Consider using environment variables in production deployment
